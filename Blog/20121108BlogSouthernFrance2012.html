When one is on a budget and doing a repeat visit to a country, they may be tempted to add a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1gqwfpeEkg&amp;feature=related" target="_blank">twist</a>. Paris is tested and true, so I decided to throw in a layover to Moscow. After all, who wouldn't want to fly with a captain who can withstand severe dizziness from dancing? (Reference to link above). After reading a few reviews and getting a "go for it" from someone with on-the-ground experience, I bought my ticket. After I'd committed, I received less favorable reviews. "<em>You are doing what?" "Isn't Moscow a bit out of the way?" "You can pray for the whole plane!" "Do you have a transit Visa?" ... "Do I need one?"</em> Official Embassy response: <em>"You shouldn't if you are there for less than 24 hours and have clear documentation you're not staying, but no guarantee, cross your fingers.</em>"

Highlights of flight:

</div>
<div>
<ul>
	<li>Upon boarding the realization that no, in fact, I don't have clear documentation. (They only gave me a boarding pass for DC-Moscow).</li>
	<li>Apparently, even the Aeroflot employees were surprised by my itinerary. <em>"I need my second boarding pass." "What is your final destination?"</em> <em>"Paris." "Paris?!?"</em> (Et tu, Aeroflot employee?)</li>
	<li>The inflight entertainment was a mix of Russian comedy and Tweety Bird.</li>
	<li>The plane applauded when we landed.</li>
</ul>

 Now that I've landed...

</div>
<div>This week I've been in Southern France in the Pyrenees-- a great area that has snow in the mountains, palm trees on the ground, and that is close to the origin of the Beret in the Pays Basque. We've visited several small towns, many churches a grotte or two (caves), and Spain! We've watched a fair amount of French television (including the election coverage... although I went to sleep before <em>any</em> of the US polling stations had closed, so it was mostly watching French people talk about swing states and attempting to explain the electoral college). We've also played copious amounts of Banagrams. Usually here I play in French and they play in English. But we recently switched it up, which I think is more helpful because then we have to explain our words to each other and I learn more than just rewriting the words I already know.</div>

I have not spoken, read, or listened to much French for 3 years. The last time I was here I was called out for that fact. <em>"Alyson, have you taken any classes since you left."</em> This time, Jean Pierre says my pronunciation is good and that I have a sophisticated vocabulary that allows me to talk about many things: politics, world affairs, life considerations, religion, etc. Ooh la la! I think I've fooled him because most of my "sophisticated vocabulary" is cognates. Adding -eux, -euses, etc. often gets you where you need to go. Also, with these "pensive topics" one is allowed to ramble a bit to make a point.

While I have given the impression of being able to speak, there is definitely improvement needed (which is why I'm grateful to be here!), specifically comprehension and writing. I am pretty useless at French small talk. There have been several times (daily) when someone suggests I must love of croissants or cheese or some other food item. I hear the word croissant and cheese, but I usually miss the rest of the sentence. This is awkward because my mind stays firmly in English and starts to run wild as I try to figure out how to respond to the situation. If they are asking me a question and I smile or say something like, I like cheese, then they will think I am an idiot. If I am too eager about croissants or cheese they will bring out more (which you would think is a good thing, except I like to eat quality food in small quantities). Also, how can I move this conversation forward? My anecdotes and fun facts about croissants and cheese (and no worries, I have them) would be too confusing and complicated to use. Maybe I should follow step 3 from  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edYHlnhxyOI" target="_blank">How to Fake French</a>: "eat if possible to avoid having to speak," but that would betray my small quantity rule.

On Saturday I'll head to Paris where I am super enthused about this Franglish program that Anna just told me about where you go and practice French and English with people. I am also hoping to secure a research card for the <a href="http://www.bnf.fr/fr/acc/x.accueil.html" target="_blank">Bibliotheque nationale de France</a>.

Tonight we are having dinner with a woman who lives in the same apartment complex. I hope she sticks to French. Because when I first met her and she learned my grandmother was German she kept trying to talk to me in German, even though all I know is "Ich habe eine schlafende Maske für dich." Which I've learned is far less useful than being able to talk about croissants.
