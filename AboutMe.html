<p>My journey into web development was kindled when I attended a Startup Weekend Conference in Washington, DC.</p>
<p>
At this conference several things were clear:
<ol>
<li>Developers were a key member of the team</li>
<li>There was abundant funding (free food and corporate sponsors weren't as prevalent in the non-profit realm)</li>
<li>There weren't many women</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
After I left the conference, I decided I wanted to learn to program. I started to attend tech meetups like:
<ul>
<li>Women who Tech</li>
<li>DC Rails Girls</li>
<li>DC Nightowls</li>
</ul>
I took classes like Java Programming, where I learned all about classes and methods. I signed up for tutorials, both low-threshold paid and unpaid. However, I felt I was merely grazing the surface. I started to research Boot Camps to learn more.
</p>
<p>
When I'm not working, I like to:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Perform improv. My first Improv showcase from the Washington Improv Theater is below:</li>

Hillary and I thought it would be fun to incorporate some of &quot;Stomp the Yard&quot; into a crazy techno tune and totally make a fool of ourselves - with the rest of the Resident Assistants - and perform it for all of the Frosh, and Fritzes.</p>Posted by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/stefanie.s.palmer.7">Stefanie &#039;Sten&#039; Palmer</a> on Friday, September 21, 2007</blockquote></div></div>
