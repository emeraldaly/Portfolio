  <h1>Slippery Slopes to Fallingwater</h1>
  <h2>12/2/2013</h2>
  <p><ul>
	<li>Rustic cabin in the woods; complete with adorable decor, stocked kitchen, and cozy corners for catching up - check.</li>
	<li>Tickets bought in advance for a tour of Fallingwater - check.</li>
	<li>Prohibitive icy roads - check...</li>
</ul></p>
<p>
One of these things was not on the itinerary.</p>
<p>
My friends are planners-- our weekend together was set from assigned meal prep to excursions padded with catch-up time. We had found a delightful cabin on Airbnb; it was close to the Pittsburgh airport and Frank Lloyd Wright's Fallingwater, but also "far away" at the end of a forested back road.</p>
<p>
Saturday morning, sitting by the warm fire, the cold outside seemed a mere inconvenience, one easily remedied by boots, hats, and warm coats.</p>
<p>
Wanting to get to the tour on time, if not early, we head out.</p>
<p>
Fast forward. Scene: Road completely covered in ice. Car stuck half way up a hill, angled to avoid sliding further but completely blocking the road, hand and foot break clutched.</p>
<p>
We learned two things that were not in the Airbnb ad. 1) The road is not maintained by the state. 2) The winter conditions were unusually icy and cold.</p>
<p>
Great.</p>
<p>
Mid-solution brainstorm, a truck full of kids drives up. We are in their way. They are going to town to sell a generator, but agree to do what they can to help. We are, afterall, blocking the only way out. They help us transport the completely solid sand bag from the cabin to put under our tires and conjure a plan to tow us up the hill.</p>
<p>
<span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">"Do you think the rope will hold?"</span></p>
<p>
"No."</p>
<p>
Abort! Abort! Our change of plans didn't require much persuasion because their truck only had enough gas to get to town and in the process of revving into position their tank became completely empty. They returned to their house waiting for us to get out of the way.</p>
<p>
After fruitlessly calling several tow companies, we called a plough guy and paid to gravel the entire length of the road. This did the trick!</p>
<p>
Back on our way we imagine how grateful everyone along the road must be that we solved the icy road issue. Wrong. It turns out that some of the kids were rather put out because they could no longer go sledding on the road.  Hmm..</p>
<p>
Similar to Fallingwater, our day did not match the original plan. When the Kaufmann family hired Frank Lloyd Wright they requested a cabin by the waterfall. Similar to mother nature, Wright had his own idea. He decided to build a beautiful house over the 30' waterfall.</p>
<p>
It truly is worth a visit! The house is artfully placed and designed down to every detail. Wright incorporated nature throughout the design with pools and fountains inside and out that are filled with the flowing water. Wright designed both the building and most of the furniture inside.</p>
<p>
More about the house and it's history, including scale drawings can be found on the Fallingwater <a href="http://www.fallingwater.org/37/what-is-fallingwater">website</a>.</p>
<p>
Despite the slick setback, the trip was wonderful! We've decided our next trip will be somewhere warm.</p>
