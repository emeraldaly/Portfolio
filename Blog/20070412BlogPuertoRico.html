Location: Puerto Rico- Vieques, Old San Juan, El Yunque

One of the resident counselors at my college created a program called Metanoia. This usually takes place over spring break and is a chance for a group to go into the wilderness to hike, camp, and find time for reflection and renewal. After a series of backpacking trips, I joined the debut trip to the beaches in Puerto Rico.

One thing I realized is how little I know about the history of Puerto Rico and its relationship to the United States. At the time, there were new restrictions for Americans traveling to Costa Rica and surrounding islands and I wasn't sure whether I needed to bring a passport with me. When I asked at the airport, I received a rude non-reply of, "didn't you take civic lessons?" It turns out, as I suspected, I did not need to bring a passport. But I am not sure how his criticism of my education (to which I was a participant and not a curriculum planner) would  help me if I found myself in Puerto Rico with someone demanding a passport and not having one. He must have been grumpy because he was not joining us on this splendid trip.

We camped on the island of Vieques-- which was spectacular. The beach was being patrolled because it was time for sea turtles to lay their eggs. When we woke up in the morning we had horses outside of our tent who had grazed their way into our campground. And one night we went to the <a href="http://biobay.com">Bioluminescent Bay</a>. The bay is full of micro-organisms that when stirred turn a vibrant blue. At the site they had kayaks for us to slither through the water leaving a bright trail behind us and wherever our paddle touched the water. We could also swim and feel like Tinker Bell as our arms and legs glowed.

To keep with tradition, we took a hike up <a href="http://www.fs.usda.gov/elyunque/">El Yunque</a>, a national rainforest. There was a great canopy growing various fruits and bananas of various shapes and sizes.
