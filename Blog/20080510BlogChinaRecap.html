  <h1>China Recap</h1>
  <h2>05/10/2008</h2>
  <p>
<p>A lot has happened since I last wrote.  The group is about to close the Beijing chapter and head out on a whirlwind voyage across China.  Tibet is closed so we will no longer be going there.  Instead we will be going on a boat along the Yangtze River to the Three Gorges Dam.  We will also be visiting Chengdu, Xi'an, Gansu Province, and Xinjiang.  It will be interesting comparing the rural and the more developed areas of China.  From what I gather there is a drastic difference.</p>
<p>Highlights from the past few weeks: We went to an orphan village for kids with deformities that is run by Americans and fully funded by donors.  The story of how it came about really is extraordinary—it involves buying land (about 6 acres) for 1 kuai (1kuai= 1 yuan or approximately $0.14 US).  We helped Olympic volunteers get ready for their work this summer (that was an exercise in patience as we had many long meetings where the sole objective was to plan a meeting time… egad).</p>
<p>I finally felt like I was in China a few days ago.  It was a sports day at the Beijing University of Technology and I was sitting watching the different events and looking out over the skyline.  As I was looking at the city I began thinking about how there is a different system and different processes in China.  If I had a problem or if I needed to accomplish something (whether it was filing taxes, going to the dentist, cooking food, calling the police, or needing legal assistance) the steps and process that I would go through would be unfamiliar.  It isn't the people, the food, or the sights that make me feel like I am in a different country.  I realized that I am in a different system and therefore a different country.  It was nice to know that there are many similarities that are more important than the differences and that even without an understanding of how their society works I can still function and get by.</p>
<p>Those that know me well might have perked up when they heard that I was at a sports day.  Brace yourselves for this next section. I participated and placed in an international athletic competition in Beijing 2008.  Did I mention I spent some time at the Olympic Village and interacted with Chinese Olympic Volunteers??  I know what you are thinking; the Olympics don't start until August.  Despite popular belief, I am not an Olympic athlete—don't be misled by the fact that I have never competed in anything athletic, apart from dance team, in my life. Breaking my no-competition streak, I ran my first 4x1 relay at a BJUT sports day and our team placed 3rd in the heat and 6th overall winning us a cool fork/spoon/chopstick travel kit.  I am sure you can imagine my excitement.  It might be important to mention that about 6 of the other teams were all wearing jeans and one girl even wore a turtleneck.  Such details aside, I will tell my story how I please.  Did I mention we were by the OLYMPIC Badminton Stadium?</p>
<p>There is a Korean restaurant near the hotel that offers a free Chinese breakfast.  The first day the whole group went.  Since then the only group involvement is: "Alyson do you still go there?  Every day?? Really?  Why?"  I don't go everyday, but I am a regular.  The breakfast consists of watery rice (similar to cream of rice but more appropriately called lake of rice), a hard-boiled egg, a steamed bun, and some pickled thing that I never eat.  It is filling and if you squint your brain a bit while you eat the bun and hard-boiled egg you can pretend that you are eating an egg sandwich.</p>
<p>I am not telling you about the breakfast so that you can all enjoy your bacon, eggs, waffles, and other delicious breakfast items while thinking of me and my rice soup.  I had a fun cultural experience there recently. The Korean woman, presumably the mother, turned off the television (which always shows Korean soap operas… perhaps that is why I go every morning) and listened to the following melodies: Amazing Grace, Sounds of Silence, and Nearer my God to Thee.  I don't know if she did this for my benefit.  I looked up and smiled to show her that I appreciated the familiar tunes.  Later she came over appearing to want to chat.  We affirmed that she did not speak English and that I only spoke yi dianr of Chinese. Through my limited Chinese, her speaking slowly, and a lot of hand gestures she told me about her life in China compared to her life in Korea.  She said it was a lot harder to live in Korea.  Here she can rest, there she was working non-stop without sleep.  It is easier to make money here.  She also talked about how large China is compared to Korea.  I'd like to think that this conversation was a reward for my dedication to the restaurant.</p>
<p>This post is almost as long as Chinese history (and it has hardly skimmed the surface of my experiences so I expect everyone to be very excited to talk to me when I get home).  It is time for a few insights. </p> <p>The Chinese are mostly concerned with their individual and family comfort.  They are content if their immediate lives are peaceful.  In this way they are not very inquisitive or curious about the affairs of other countries.  I have met exceptions.  Which is another insight: there are no absolutes with any group of people as there are always exceptions.</p>
<p>Ice cream is increasingly popular.  I see people eating it all the time.  Copyright law exists in China but it is not enforced.  Apparently there are more important things for the authorities to devote their time doing.  (I do see them marching a lot…) The Chinese do not walk around puddles when it rains; they walk right through them.  Bubble tea can be found in several locations.  It has been my experience that when you order one they give you two.</p>
<p>If there is anything in particular that anyone would like to know about China let me know and I will try to focus on that in future posts. I am not sure when my next post will be sent out since my internet connection over the next few weeks will not be consistent.</p>
