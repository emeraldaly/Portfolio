Location: Germany- Nurnberg, Berlin, Frankfurt, Koln, Bonn

After college I bought a one way ticket to Europe with plans to travel for 1-2 months. Reality hits in July: summer one-way return tickets are expensive! My total trip became three months and while en route I found a professional conference to attend and joined an amazing 2 week program for 60 international students from 20 countries learning about being active citizens.

Itinerary Highlights: Hiking near Nurnberg; Attending Symposium at <a href="http://www.culturaldiplomacy.org/index.php?en">Institute for Cultural Diplomacy</a>; Tour of <a href="http://www.olympic.org/berlin-1936-summer-olympics">1936 Berlin Olympic</a> Stadium; Collaborating with team for a two week <a href="http://www.uwc.org/how_to_apply/find_your_national_committee/germany.aspx">United World College</a> short course; Flash Mob in Frankfurt with students to raise awareness about homelessness; Dancing in Koln, Frankfurt &amp; Nurnberg; Climbing the <a href="http://www.koelner-dom.de">Dom in Koln</a>; <a href="http://www.adidas.de">Adidas</a>, <a href="http://www.shop.puma.de">Puma</a>, and <a href="http://www.haribo.com/planet/us/startseite.php">Haribo</a> Outlets.

I never had a chance to study German in school, but have always been fascinated with the country as both of my grandparents on my mother's side have roots there. The setting-- with the style of the buildings, landscape, and Brothers Grimm legacy-- is primed for stories and I experienced many during my stay.

I have been involved in many group activities similar to the short course and a typical beginning is some sort of name game or group introduction. What I am not used to is having people actually remember anyone's names from this exercise. Once a group hits a certain size it is a good starter for future connections. I was quite surprised how many people remembered my name off the bat. I learned this is because I was the only American and for some of them the first they had met. Thereafter, anything I did was assumed to be an American trend. Does everyone laugh like you? Absolutely not! I have quite the unique laugh-- memorable and best in small doses. Does everyone sit in <a href="http://www.crazycreek.com">Crazy Creek</a> chairs? If only-- I personally think they are amazing. But perhaps the most interesting exchange was during our international fair where participants and facilitators set up booths about their home country to share. I found people didn't come with questions, but with facts and theories they wanted to share with me. They told me where they'd been in the US, one person folded a dollar bill and showed me how it looked like the twin towers burning, and I got into a dispute with someone about the origins of Sesame Street. They were convinced <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sesamstraße">Sesamstraße</a> came first.

After the course one of the other facilitators and I traveled up to Koln together. She is from Bulgaria and her dad had flown over to vacation with her. He sells Garmin products in Bulgaria. Once we were all buckled into the car he turns and says to me, "I hear you have a GPS." True. But I pause because I am looking at the dashboard where there are 3 GPS's secured to the dashboard. "Yes, but it looks like you have enough." "It is always better to have more!" He then takes down one of his and puts up mine. Now, I learned a few months later after driving the most out of the way routes possible in the US, that my GPS was in pedestrian mode. Therefore what ensued was quite comical. I call it GPS duel. His GPS's would say their directions in Bulgarian and he would translate for me. Then my GPS would give alternate directions in English. As we could only follow one course, one of the GPS's was constantly "recalculating" and informing us of its action.
