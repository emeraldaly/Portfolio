  <h1>More China</h1>
  <h2>05/20/2008</h2>

<p>Our group is currently in Xi'an (the former capital Chang An which is known for being an historic cultural center because of its position along the Silk Road).  Tomorrow we will be flying to Jaiyuguan in the Gansu Corridor.  We will be traveling west visiting cities along the Silk Road.  As we go farther west it will become hotter and more important to dress modestly.  Great combination.</p>

<p>Yesterday at 2:28 all of China united for three minutes to commemorate the earthquake.  Our group had the privilege of joining in.  In the United States we would have had a moment of silence.  In China, they have a moment of noise.  For three minutes sirens sounded across the country.  John Williams later explained the significance of this to us.  Apparently one of the original uses of dynamite was to scare off demons.  Noise carries the traditional meaning of repelling evil.</p>

<p>It was a touching moment to see everyone together and to know that this same event (at the exact same time) was happening in cities across China.  (It is able to be at the same time because China only has one time zone.  The country is so large that it crosses several time zones, but all clocks are set to match Beijing).  We have encountered several Chinese who are very emotional about the earthquake.  They do not even necessarily have any friends or relatives who were directly affected.  There is a real sense of brotherhood and unity among the people.</p>

<p>I didn't see this following incident, but it was shared in a debriefing later that evening.  A woman gestured to the crowd and said "women pengyou" (we are all friends) capturing the solidarity among all of the Chinese standing together.  What was especially cool was that she made a point of letting the guys know that she was including them in her group embrace.

<p>Yesterday we learned about the informal job market.  Men sit along the street with their tools of trade (electronic equipment, sledgehammers, etc.) waiting for people to approach them and hire them.  These men are usually from the country and they come to the city to make more money doing these odd jobs.  I wish they spoke English, because they would be the most interesting people to talk to about the uneven economic development in China.  I haven't been to their homes, but from what I hear it is not like the city.  I would love to hear their insights from regularly entering a world where their fellow Chinese are living such a different standard of life.</p>

<p>Chinese airlines are pretty different.  On a one-hour flight we were served a hot meal and a drink.  On a 2.5 hour meal we were served two meals.  Also, the flight attendants all gather at the front of the plane before landing to thank everyone for flying and to bow to the passengers.  There were no peanuts served.</p>

<p>Last week the group spent about four days traveling along the Yangtze River.  We had the opportunity to go through the locks and the Three Gorges Dam.  Before the dam was built the water level was about 120 m.  After the dam is finished being built, the water level is supposed to rise up to 165 m.  The building of the Dam is a huge endeavor.  Not only does it involve designing and building the dam, but also thousands of people are being relocated and some historic sights have been moved to higher ground. We had the opportunity to visit a city where thousands of people had successfully been relocated.  We visited one of the homes and met an older couple.  Apparently housing is guaranteed, but the process of finding an apartment is like a raffle.  This couple was fortunate that they got an apartment on the first floor.</p>
<p>Another cool thing about being on the Yangtze tour was talking to the employees on the boat.  I befriended the calligraphist on the ship.  He didn't speak much English, but he was very resourceful to help us communicate.  I was able to communicate who I was, how long I was in China, where I was studying through using my limited Chinese, a calculator, and woman who spoke more English across the way.  There was a definite change when he knew that I was learning Chinese.  Another passenger came over and after he left, the calligraphist communicated that there was a difference between the two of us—I was here to learn.  Later I was able to help him make a sale by helping a couple communicate.</p>

<p>I am curious what the news is in the United States about China and the earthquakes.  Things seem in control here and I haven't heard any negative reports about how it is being dealt with.  The day of the earthquake Prime Minister Wen went to the site to check out the situation.  Our group decided not to go to Chengdu to give the government space for relief efforts.  The communication with the planning wasn't shared with me.  But my impression is that the city was technically open, but there was no guarantee for our flight out of Chengdu and that it would be helpful for the government and people to focus on the relief efforts if there were less foreigners visiting.  People in the group wanted to help out, but it seems the most helpful thing that we could do is to prayerfully support the effort.</p>
