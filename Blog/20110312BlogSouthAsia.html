Location: Singapore, Indonesia &amp; South Korea

My mother got a job teaching 6th grade math and science at Jakarta International School! Check out her blog B<a href="http://brendawright.blogspot.com">renda's Beat</a>. Very cool, but logistically more difficult to visit her with the long flights coupled with limited vacation time from work. We planned an itinerary that included Singapore, Bali &amp; Jakarta, Indonesia--all in seven days. In case that schedule wasn't dense enough, I booked a long lay-over in South Korea on the way back.

When I travel I like to plan my trips to destinations where I know people. This allows me to visit friends and see sights and have experiences that would be difficult to plan from a Google search or tour book. My friend Jin Xin was studying in Singapore, so off we went. I had heard rumors of good shopping and assurance that everyone spoke English, but did not know what to expect beyond that. You can imagine my surprise when our first stop was <a href="http://www.yoursingapore.com/content/traveller/en/browse/see-and-do/nature-and-wildlife/island-retreat/sentosa-island.html">Sentosa Island</a>. This is the most southern point of Continental Asia and it is not exactly a heritage site. But it was a great place to take pictures with statues and mosaics on a path that led to the beach. Other sites we visited included Little India, the <a href="http://en.red-dot.org/2049.html">Red Dot Museum</a>, and <a href="http://www.clarkequay.com.sg/malls/website/index.aspx">Clarke Quay</a>. Not bad for the allotted day.

We spent the longest part of our trip in Bali. Indonesia is the most populous Muslim country, but Bali is mainly Hindu. It is an acclaimed spot to vacation and has been nicknamed Bule (meaning white person). Everyone was extremely friendly and wanted to help us see the sites. We went biking in <a href="http://www.lonelyplanet.com/indonesia/bali/ubud">Ubud</a> (which was more like "sitting" since they drove us to the top of the hill and we "rolled" down). The tour took us to different sites including work sites, an artist's home, a coffee plantation &amp; Hindu temples.

In Jakarta the main objective was to approve where our mom was living. She showed us her school, a nearby boat yard, and gave us a taste for how congested the traffic is there. We also got together with friends from college and had lunch at <a href="http://www.dapursolo.com/resto.php">Dapur Solo</a> (an Indonesian restaurant owned by their family).

And finally, the South Korean airport! It is quite the cultural experience in and of itself. They have classes you can take, free wifi and business centers strewn about, shopping, and shows. However I couldn't stay there. When my sister learned I was stopping over in South Korea she gave me a mission. She adores children's books and follows illustrators. One of her favorite blogs taught her about a Korean illustrator whose style particularly peaked her interest and who was not sold in the States. So I embarked on a quest to Kyobo Bookstore to track down these books for her. As it was Sunday and I had only 12 hours to figure out the currency, train system, and to navigate the city, I decided to start by going to church. I missed the English portion, but was rewarded for my efforts as one of the church members treated me to a full blown, multi-course Korean meal, and then helped me get to the bookstore and helped me buy the right books. It was a whirl-- but imbibed everything I love about traveling: meeting new people, overcoming language barriers, and successfully figuring out how to get around.
