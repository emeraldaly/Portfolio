Location: France- Paris, Pau, Bordeaux, Normandy, Pays Basque, Dune de Pyla, Sarlat

My freshmen year of college I studied abroad in France. We were a group of 16-- 15 girls and 1 boy. He was very patient and badgered by waiters. The French department is very demanding as they strive to immerse their students in a language on campus while competing with their other courses and activities. Being in France was also busy-- but more natural and relaxed because the challenge was living day to day and communicating versus doing worksheets and language exercises.

The itinerary was quite full and so were we from all the scrumptious meals! Itinerary Highlights: Food; Exploring <a href="http://www.grottes-en-france.com/en/grottes/lacave.html">Grottes</a> (caves with Paleolithic cave paintings); Climbing <a href="http://www.dune-pyla.com/en/">Dune du Pyla</a>; Home stay families; Weekend trips to <a href="http://www.normandie-tourisme.fr/articles/omaha-beach-338-2.html">Normandy</a>, <a href="http://www.sarlat-tourisme.com/en/">Sarlat</a> and <a href="http://www.touradour.com/history/basque.htm">Pays Basque</a>; French language classes; Visiting <a href="http://www.louvre.fr/en">Louvre</a>, <a href="http://www.musee-rodin.fr">Musee Rodin</a>, <a href="http://www.musee-orsay.fr/en/home.html">Musee D'Orsay</a>, <a href="http://www.sacre-coeur-montmartre.com">Sacre Coeur</a>, <a href="http://www.tour-eiffel.fr">Eiffel Tower</a>, <a href="http://en.chateauversailles.fr/homepage">Versailles</a>.

Communicating in France is not easy. It requires much more thought and effort than speaking English. My phone card doesn't work very well so it was hard to call home. I thought I would be able to easily express myself via email. I slowly got better.

Here is my first attempt:

This keyboard is weird:::: finqlly a good thing about this messed up email.  I can write any accent I want;  éèçàù.  well french ones anyway. If I knew swedish I*d be no better off.  I feel really discobbected;  I cqn*t call easily, I now know I can*t write easily:  AI YI YI:  How am I going to write papers???  I should have brought my laptop.  There are so many cute store, streets, sights, lights, people to watch, places to see; and verbs to try to conjugate.  I will try to call sometime;  I don*t know when you are in your room:  It is expensive to cqll-- not to mention obnoxious:  Hmm.  I will try anyway, it will no doubt be better than this lameness:
Love; Qlyson

After some time:

Hey,
Forewarning: this keyboard is weird and I am having a hard time adjusting to it.  I arrived safely and I am having a wonderful time.  The food is great, the city is beautiful, the group is nice, the teachers are being very nice.  Day to day the city is calm and great.  There are definitely signs of the unrest.  Yesterday there was a metro sit-in where the stuidents blocked one of the stops and then at midnight there was a demonstration right down the street by my hotel;  I watched the whole thing from my window.  The hotel is in the latin quarter, right by the Sorbonne.  The students all flocked in around this fence that closes off the police.  There was some throwing of stuff, some tear gas, but overall it was calm and organized.  It was very cool to watch.  I feel very safe and there is nothing to worry about;  Today I saw the Eiffel Tower; the Bastille; the arc de triomphe, and a few other sites around the city.  It is beautiful.    I have been practicing my french a lot.  I will talk to you later;
Love, Alyson

Getting better:

I am in France now.  I just spent a week in Paris and I have just arrived in Pau today where I am staying with a host family.  They are very nice and I can usually tell what is going on.  I like the Dad.  He corrects my french.  I am sure there are a lot more things he could mention.  Right now he focuses mainly on gender agreement and blatant pronunciation problems.  It will be interesting to see how I can progress.  Paris was rather exciting.  We saw a lot of the monuments etc.  Plus, I got to see some of the domonstrations.  Our hotel was in the latin quarter right across from the Sorbonne.  The first night there was a demonstration that we watched from our hotel window.  It was quite entertaining,  We had to close our windows when the police threw tear gas.  That wasn't very comfortable.  But, it was very safe.  I didn't feel any tension or hostility.  Then there was a national strike on tuesday which delayed our visit to the Musee Orsay.  We ended up visiting the museum today instead of last Tuesday.  Then, when we were getting ready to leave Paris there was another demonstration in the street.  Luckily, our bus driver had arrived right before all the students.  This was very good because the students completely blocked the streets with their protests.  Some of the other students on the abroad decided to sit in the street for a bit with the other students.  It was really interesting to see.  I hope everything is going well!  Talk to you later.

Later:
<div>Bonjour!</div>
<div>    Je suis a Bordeaux et c'est un ville tres jolie.  Cette weekend est tres long parce que lundi est un holiday.   And now some English... How is everything?  France is going very well, it is a nice pace with time to learn, absorb, think, read, and explore the city.</div>
