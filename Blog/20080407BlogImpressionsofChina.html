  <h1>Impressions of China</h1>
  <h2>04/07/2008</h2>

<p>It has been hard to capture impressions, thoughts, and feelings about China so far.  Every time I sit down to type I feel like I am stalling or forming sentences that are awkward because I am forcing or overthinking their construction.  I have two theories.  Either I am overwhelmed because there is so much to take in or the need to talk slowly and with precision with the Chinese has affected my writing flow.
</p>
<p>My biggest fear about China was that there would be smog and pollution hanging over the city.  I wasn't comforted when we flew into the airport into a lifeless haze.  It turns out it was just a rainy day.  The next day we were greeted with a blue sky with air worthy of exclamations from the group (verbatim), "the air actually smells good and fresh."  I am curious if this is because of efforts to clean up the air in time for the Olympics, a result of long-term improvements, or the time of the year.
</p>
<p>The first morning while walking around the university I began to feel very self-conscious that I had packed a coat that was too bright.  Everyone was staring at me.  Discomfort melted into a realization that my bright red hair, pale skin, and height were probably much more noticeable than my blue coat.
</p>Our group has been very popular in China.  If our life were a reality show, and whose isn't really, it would be called "Rich and Famous."   Walking down the street people are constantly trying to sell us stuff and take our picture.  There is a mix of people; some ask us outright to pose with us while others act like paparazzi "discreetly" posing in front of us smiling.  It becomes obvious when we shift and they start dancing to readjust their angle.  Sadly, the biggest cultural re-immersion that I am anticipating will be having to stop my automatic "picture smile" anytime anyone anywhere pulls out a camera.
</p>
<p>There is a lot of four-legged evidence that China is a country in transition.  I had heard that there are no pets in China—when my Mom was in Southern China the only cat she saw was on a leash.  I don't know if it is a north-south difference or a general trend, but there are pets everywhere in China.  There are a bunch of little dogs (never any big dogs) and they own the street.  Some are on leashes, but most prance around freely with their owners trailing behind.  Some of them even have customized jackets.  I knew this was a new China when I saw a poodle with a pink tail and pink ears.
</p>
<p>Despite China's new fascination with dogs, you can still order it in a restaurant.  I am not sure how common this is.  Our Chinese teacher was shocked that we had ordered dog (as were several members of the group), she hadn't ever eaten dog.
</p>
<p>China is a mix of old and new.  There are expensive shiny cars riding along side beat up buses and rickshaws.  Women sporting stylish coats, all dolled up, alongside weathered older men and women.  There are clear signs that either globalization is in full swing or they are gearing up for the Olympics because English is increasingly on signs and used in public transportation.
</p>
<p>Concluding observation: if China were to have a soundtrack it would consist largely of honking.</p>
