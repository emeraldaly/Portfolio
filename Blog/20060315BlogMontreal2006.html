Location: Canada-Montreal

The spring quarter of my freshmen year two friends and I planned a trip to Montreal. I was going to be studying abroad in France in the Spring and thought it would be a great way to practice French. It turned out to be St. Patrick's day and as we were all under 21, we had a difficult time explaining to people we weren't there to drink but practice French.

Getting there was quite the adventure. I planned to take a bus from New Hampshire and would meet my two friends at the train station in Montreal. Unfortunately, in Burlington, VT I was told by the bus driver that I had been given a "non-ticket." My round-trip ticket was mislabeled and said Concord-Concord (NH) vs. Concord-Montreal. To continue, I would have to pay $10 in cash (I had $8) and then rebuy the return ticket once I arrived and I could sort out a reimbursement with the bus company when I returned. I didn't have a cell phone so being on schedule for our meeting at the train station was crucial. There was no ATM in sight. It all worked out-- I was given $2 from another passenger and the bus company in Concord reimbursed me after laughing and saying, "that was you?"

Montreal is a beautiful city. My family went on vacation there a few times over the years and it was on one of those trips that I decided to learn French. People kept speaking to me in French and in English to my family. Very bizarre.

We stayed at a Youth Hostel, which provided many new adventures. Also staying there was a guy from Mexico who was competing an International Squash Tournament. He invited us to come and watch. There also is a vibrant art scene and we weaved in and out of small art galleries.
