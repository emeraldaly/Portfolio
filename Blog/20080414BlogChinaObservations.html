  <h1>China Observations</h1>

<p>The Chinese usually, no always, pronounce 'usually' without an s.  This is not a big deal because I can infer from the context what they mean.  I only notice it because when I try to speak in Chinese and my tones are slightly off I am met with blank stares.  A pause… empty and long… I repeat Wo yao mifan.  Silence.  OH, you mean wo yao mifan.  Now the silence is on my end as I try to relive that moment in my life listening to see how what they said sounds different that what I said.  I am sharing this for a comedic effect, it doesn't bother me at all...  well not uually.  More it is frustrating because I want to be able to practice Chinese and not always rely on their knowledge of English. </p>
<p>
It is very evident that China is getting ready for the Olympics.  There are advertisements around the city, all cars have 2008 Beijing bumper stickers, and there is construction 24/7.  The people are very proud of their country and excited to share with the world.  I have really appreciated the genuineness of the Chinese people, their sincerity and hospitality. </p>
<p>The Chinese have been very sensitive about how China is being viewed. Several people have asked whether we think the pollution is a problem.  They are also a bit confused and saddened by the current response to the Olympics.  They don't understand why people are protesting.  The people I have talked to see it as a comment on the Chinese versus China's position in Tibet.  One person told me they wished that the world would explain why they are upset.  It seems the media is not communicating the entire story, so the people just feel like people have something against the Chinese. </p>
<p>I am trying to figure out boy girl relationships in China.  I was under the impression that there is not much dating during middle and high school.  However, college does not seem restricted.  On the university campus and around the city I have seen a lot of couples.  It is very common to see people holding hands (usually friends of the same gender) but there are also a lot of boys and girls riding on the same bike, walking together, and even breaching PDA (public displays of affection) lines. I also learned that boys are never allowed in girls dorms at Peking University and foreign women (maybe all women, I am not sure) are not allowed in mens dorms. (I don't know if this applies to all campuses or just the one I was visiting with a friend). Makes you rethink the strictness of Prin's house hours.</p>
<p>There doesn't seem to be a sense or inferiority with different jobs in China.  We do Tai Chi every Wednesday morning outside of our hotel.  During our Tai Chi lesson a woman started sweeping.  She probably does this every morning and was intent on finishing.  The problem was that the dirt she was sweeping was flying into our space and she was rapidly moving into our Tai Chi class.  The teacher went over to ask the woman to wait until we were finished.  The look she gave the teacher was not one of yielding or understanding.  It was an "I have a job to do and I will do it now" look.  Our teacher came back, shrugged, and continued on with the class. </p>
<p>Driving is quite the adventure.  Yesterday we went to the Great Wall, the Ming Tombs, and to some other sites.  We had a cultural learning moment when our driver missed his exit.  In the NH drivers manual it very clearly communicates that if you miss the exit you are to go to the next exit, get off, get back on going the other direction, and then get off when you pass by the correct exit. In China, they have not read the NH drivers manual.  Our bus driver stopped in the break down lane, backed up the bus and repositioned it to get off at the exit. I was grateful that it was not a very busy road. </p>
<p>Spring and warmer weather is arriving.  Our school is surrounded by these cotton puff balls that are pretty and slightly majestic until you swallow one when talking.</p>
