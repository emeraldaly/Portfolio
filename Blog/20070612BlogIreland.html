Location: Ireland Cork &amp; Dublin + side trips

As a redhead, people often think I am Irish. But just because I am not, that doesn't mean I can't fully appreciate the beautiful country! My Dad is a law professor and had the chance to teach a few courses in Cork, Ireland. While he taught, we explored Cork. It turns out there aren't many museums there. But we did go to the one we found. The Butter Museum. It turns out that salty Irish butter was very popular before refrigeration. It is still delicious, but there was more competition after the fridge became mainstream. This may be why the second floor of the museum was dedicated to the risky and illegal, but popular, activity of cattle raiding.

A thrill was renting bikes and touring theÂ <a href="http://www.muckross-house.ie">Muckross House</a>. This was one of Ireland's first national parks. The grounds are lovely full of flowers, beautiful landscapes, and outdoor hiking and biking. In fact, this was one of the few days where I could have justified eating the Irish breakfast. This meal is deserved by people who put in a long, hard day of manual labor. I rarely do and couldn't help but calculate the number of calories in the eggs, ham, sausage, beans, and a tomato (to feel healthy). Delicious and wonderful-- but more than I usually intake in a week.
