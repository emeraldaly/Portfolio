  <h1>Calling London</h1>
  <h2>04/01/2012</h2>
  <p>
A few weeks ago on my commute to work I saw a woman walking down the street on a phone. Not a wanna be "CIA blue tooth" phone and not a "brick smooshed into her face" smartphone. An actual full handled red phone.

I had to have one.

Not having a particularly rebellious childhood, I see my red phone as the mohawk/tattoo/attention garnering accessory that I never wore. It has been fun walking around talking and noticing the unusual amount of attention it generates.

When I went to London I knew that I needed to bring it.

Today it is hung up in my room. I learned that in addition to not fitting in my purse, it short circuits my phone so that I can not hear out of the handset unless I reboot the phone. Fun, but not practical.
