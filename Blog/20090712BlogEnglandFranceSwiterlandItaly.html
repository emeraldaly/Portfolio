Location: London, UK; Paris &amp; Pau, France; Geneva Switzerland; Venice, Vicenza, Verona, Milan &amp; Lake Como, Italy

To celebrate the end of college, one of my best friends and I decided to travel around Europe for the summer. She was studying abroad in Greece in the Spring, so we had one phone call to lay the groundwork. We would meet in London and buy a rail pass for France, Italy, Germany, and Switzerland.

We chose the date of our arrival around an exhibit at the British Museum, which we didn't end up seeing. It is actually a bit pathetic and an example where things don't line up perfectly. We did go to the British Museum on the last day of the exhibit. But we were in the tender spot- no longer students, but not yet employed- and the entrance fee was prohibitive. Now for the pathetic, but still cool part. One of our professors at school had served in Iraq and she arranged for us to meet up with one of her Iraqi friends the following day. It was great because he brought the Babylon exhibit to life sharing details about how the plants depicted confirmed what the climate was historically. We also learned he was a member of the British museum and could have gotten us into the exhibit for free. It had ended. But London never fails to disappoint-- we saw Billy Elliot, explored the Tate Museum, and felt wildly underdressed in our "travel outfits." A lesson I learned is that unless I am hardcore hiking, when I travel I can wear the same clothes I normally do.

My friend and I had studied in France together our Freshmen year of college. So this part of the trip was a bit memory lane. We explored Paris-- revisiting our favorite spots and finding some new ones like the <a href="http://www.traveltowellness.com/parishammam">Paris Hammam</a>. And then we went to Pau, a small town in the Pyrenees to visit my host mother. She always offers great food and experiences. This year she brought us to <a href="http://www.tourisme-leboulou.fr/en/thermalisme/cure-thermale.html">Le Boulou</a>, a thermal spa.

As international relations majors, a highlight from Switzerland was visiting the United Nations. Although it was a little disconcerting to learn that I didn't know enough languages to even be a tour guide. One of the coolest parts was the ceiling of one of the new conference rooms. It had just been finished and resembled the surface of a spiky, multi-colored topographic map. The inspiration was that from every seat the landscape looks a bit different and that all views are needed to be an effective and representative organization.

In Italy, my friend's mom was joining so I was by myself for a bit. I usually travel by myself, but I am usually meeting someone and wasn't completely comfortable going full speed alone. One afternoon before we split I planned an ambitious full-blown Italy tour where I would see all the major cities. But I was relieved when my physics professor from college wrote to me and offered alternate plans. I had worked for him in the Physics department for three years and became good friends with him and his wife. It turns out that he was at Lake Como for a positron conference and invited me to come join them. I found a hostel across the lake and would spend my evenings and mornings talking with world travelers and then ferry over to spend the afternoon with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron">positron</a> physicists.

I was thrilled to have people to be with, but the train ride was a bit difficult. I took an early morning train down and used the trip to finish my night's rest. I was startled awake by the ticket collector speaking fast Italian. Suddenly wide-eyed but still sleepy I showed him my train ticket receipt instead of the ticket. He continued to shout and went over to a sign and showed me how much I would have to pay for my failure to procure a train ticket. I made a general request to the train for some Italian-English help and a guy wearing dark clothes and slumped over listening to music came to my aid. Later when I met up with my friend and her mom in Verona I ran into the same guy at the opera Carmen at the <a href="http://www.arena.it/en-US/HOMEen.html">Arena Verona</a>. He was one of the ushers!
