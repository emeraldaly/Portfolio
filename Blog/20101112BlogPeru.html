Location: Peru-- Lima, Cusco &amp; Machu Picchu

After graduating I outlined different elements I wanted to include in my life. In addition to fulfilling work, friends, and fun activities, I wanted to continue to travel. After working at my first full time job  for a few months the reality that employment crimps travel time was evident.

One of my roommates had recently moved to Cusco, Peru to work for <a href="http://www.girlsportworks.org">GirlSportWorks</a>, a non-profit that uses sports to teach life skills to girls in Cusco. Very cool and inspiring! We would regularly get emails about the people she was meeting, the different ages and circumstances of the girls she worked with, and how we should all come to visit.

Unfortunately, my vacation days were limited and already mostly pre-planned for a future visit to my mother in Indonesia. To stay true to my commitment to travel, I planned a 4-day trip over the Thanksgiving break.That month my department held an awards dinner, which offered some comp days that provided wiggle-grace to the federal holiday.

The time was short-- but packed! Upon arrival Margie and I dropped off my things and armed with a bag of soccer balls and jerseys we took a cab, a group cab, and then a batman themed mototaxi (similar to a rickshaw) up to a rural school. Before, after, and sometimes during the game, the girls would congregate and listen to music on a small radio. I can't say how the game went-- apart from the fact that Margie was a great instructor!-- because I fell asleep on the side of the field from the jetlag and altitude adjustment.

One of our objectives of the trip was to celebrate Thanksgiving! Another one of our friends was studying spanish and his host mother offered her home for our festivities. I was given a list of ingredients to smuggle, I mean bring, with me. There really was no smuggling at all. Quite the opposite. I was actually reprimanded for being so thorough in declaring every single packaged and canned food item I brought with me.

We were in charge of bringing the cranberries and pumpkin pie. We learned first hand that things bake differently at high altitude. Our friends host family took care of the rest, including a large turkey stuffed with ham and sausage. It was quite different than the pilgrims, but delicious and new. And the best part of Thanksgiving was preserved-- time with friends, telling stories, and reveling in all the reasons we have to be grateful.

Before I flew back, I spent the afternoon with a woman in Lima. She went to the church in Lima and graciously offered to show me around and invited me into her home. One of the things she showed me was a book of all the diverse areas and sites to see in Peru-- openly hinting that I had to come back.  True, but I have to say in 4 days I saw a lot. Two sites that were particularly fun was <a href="http://www.cusco.info/saqsaywaman.htm">Saqsaywaman</a> (which sounds like "sexy woman") and Machu Picchu. Around Cusco and specifically at Saqsaywaman there are spectacular examples of flawless building-- perfectly fitted stone walls. The tour guide was very proud to share with us Peru's rich history and I couldn't help but notice him comparing the "superior" skill of the Incas compared to the Spanish buildings.

And of course Machu Picchu was amazing! The logistics of how it was built so high in the mountains, and later how it was discovered, is spectacular. Getting there was not easy. We took the train and then a bus up the steep switch backs. The road up is one lane with buses going full speed in both directions. It felt a bit alpha male. Whenever the buses would meet there was a tense moment as we waited to see which bus would give way. I was a bit frightened, but honestly not surprised, when our bus ended the trip with an outpour of smoke from the engine. The risk was worth it as we had a whole afternoon to explore the site, to climb a few peaks, and to take as many pictures with and of llamas as our hearts desired. We ended the day with dinner-- I had guinea pig (which I'm glad to have done but probably won't repeat) and my friend had a calzone.
